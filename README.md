# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using unsupervised learning, specifically leveraging the **K-means clustering** algorithm to group customers based on purchasing behavior. The analysis is performed using R, with the help of libraries like `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments that can be used for targeted marketing strategies or personalized services.

## Key Concepts:
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points together.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Used for dimensionality reduction, helping to visualize the clusters in a 2D space while retaining most of the original variance.
  
## Dataset
The dataset includes customer behavior data with the following key attributes:
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `age`: Age of the customer
- `annual_income`: Annual income of the customer
- `purchase_amount`: Total amount spent by the customer
- `loyalty_score`: Score reflecting customer loyalty
- `region`: Geographic region of the customer
- `purchase_frequency`: Frequency of purchases in a given time period

## Tools and Libraries
This project was completed in **R**, using the following libraries:
- `ggplot2`: For data visualization, particularly to plot the results of K-means and PCA.
- `dplyr`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- `tidyr`: For reshaping the data as required.
- `factoextra`: For evaluating clustering models and visualizing results.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and standardize the dataset, ensuring numerical consistency (e.g., scaling the features).
2. **K-means Clustering**: Implement the K-means algorithm with varying values of **k** (number of clusters), and use the **elbow method** to select the best value of **k**.
3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization, allowing for the 2D representation of high-dimensional clusters.
4. **Clustering Visualization**: Generate a 2D plot of customer segments with respect to the principal components to visually inspect cluster distribution.
5. **Analysis**: Draw conclusions about customer behavior and identify actionable segments.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `CustomerSegmentation.R` script in RStudio (or an R environment).
3. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "factoextra"))
Run the script to reproduce the analysis, segmentation results, and visualizations.
## Results
The K-means clustering and PCA analysis reveal distinct customer segments with varying purchasing behaviors, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer segmentation, offering potential for more targeted business strategies and improving customer experience.
